So, there are a lot of fantastic hobbies out there, particularily for the creative folk. While I gravitate to the arts, baking, and knitting, I am in no way in my final hobby enthusiast form.

Here is a brief history of some of the hobbies I have explored, and some things I hope to learn in the future.


## Pottery
Okay, so before taking a couple local pottery classes a few years ago, I wondered if I could be a naturally gifted at pottery. Beautiful, smooth clay cups and bowls and plates look so simple. But the pottery wheel truly humbled me. There was frustration, tears, and, ultimately, a realisation that handbuilding with clay brings me much more joy. So, while my vision for a beautiful coffee cup did not come to fruition, I did walk away with several pumpkins, a hatching chick, a blue bird, and a strange turtle.

###### Reccomend? Absolutely! 



## Silversmithing
So this one is a bit of a call back to my college love, welding. Melting metal, making something new sounded interesting. And getting to make a piece of jewelry, too?! What is not to love?! 
While the instructor was so cool, and the ring I made turned out great, I cannot say silversmithing is going on my top 5 hobbies list. But that is so okay. I learned a lot- and realized that the delicate, sensitive nature of it is not something I find satisfying.

###### Ranking: 2.5/5 

###### Reccomend: Yes! Everyone should try this. I have way more respect for jewery makers,



## Pressed Flowers
My mom found a local class on pressed flowers, and asked if I was interested. Since I knew very very little about pressed flowers, I was like, sign me up! We both learned a lot. There really is an art to flattening, cutting, and caring for flowers in the press that wowed me. It is simple in some ways, but complicated in others! What really stood out to me was: how long it takes to actually get a good pressed flower and how pigment changes during the process.

###### Ranking: 4/5 Easy, but also endless potential

###### Reccomend: Of course. 



## Final Thoughts
New skills are so fun tor try. Clearly, I think it is always worth it to try a new skill
