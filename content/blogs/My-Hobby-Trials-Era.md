So, there are a lot of fantastic hobbies out there, particularily for the creative folk. While I gravitate to the arts, baking, and knitting, I am in no way in my final hobby enthusiast form. Bring on the learning! 

Here is a brief history of some of the hobbies I have explored, and some things I hope to learn in the future.

## Pottery
Okay, so before taking a couple local pottery classes a few years ago, I wondered if I could be a naturally gifted at pottery. Beautiful, smooth clay cups and bowls and plates look so simple. But the pottery wheel truly humbled me. There was frustration, tears, and, ultimately, a realisation that handbuilding with clay brings me much more joy.
