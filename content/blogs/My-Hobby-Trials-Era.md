So, there are a lot of fantastic hobbies out there, particularily for the creative folk. While I gravitate to the arts, baking, and knitting, I am in no way in my final hobby enthusiast form. Learning is almost as fun as hobbies. Maybe it is a hobby all on its own...

Here is a brief history of some of the hobbies I have explored. 


## Pottery
Okay, so before taking a couple local pottery classes a few years ago, I wondered if I could be a naturally gifted at pottery. Beautiful, smooth clay cups and bowls and plates look so simple. Internet people make it look effortless. And so did some of the other pottery students. But the pottery wheel truly humbled me. There was frustration, tears, and, ultimately, a realisation that handbuilding with clay brings me much more joy. I decided to lean into that direction, and ended up having a lot of fun with clay after all. So, while my vision for a beautiful coffee cup that fit perfectly in my hands did not come to fruition, I did walk away with several pumpkins, a hatching chick, a blue bird, and a strange turtle. Not bad!

###### Ranking: 4/5 

###### Reccomend? Absolutely! The magic of seeing the clay thing you made after the glaze and the kiln is such a treat.



## Silversmithing
So this class was taken on a whim, with very little prior knowledge. I thought it would be like welding on a smaller scale, but did not really have any other inkling of what we would learn.
While the instructor was so cool, and the ring I made turned out great, I cannot say silversmithing is going on my top 5 hobbies list. But that is okay. I learned a lot- and realized that the delicate, sensitive nature of it is not something I find satisfying.

###### Ranking: 2.5/5 

###### Reccomend: Yes! Everyone should try this. 



## Pressed Flowers
My mom found a local class on pressed flowers, and asked if I was interested. Since I knew very very little about pressed flowers, I was like, sign me up! We both learned a lot. There really is an art to flattening, cutting, and caring for flowers in the press that wowed me. It is simple in some ways, but complicated in others! What really stood out to me was: how long it takes to actually get a good pressed flower and how pigment changes during the process. 

###### Ranking: 4/5 Easy, but also endless potential

###### Reccomend: Of course. A really nice pressed flower is stunning and worth the work!

## Weaving
 Going in, I thought maybe this could be a runner up for new favorite thing, since I do enjoy working with yarn already. While I had a good time soaking in everything and fell into the groove of  I liked seeing how various colors interacted, and I had a good time learning the patterns. However, overall, this is not a hobby I would like to revisit anytime soon. Maybe it is the mathematical side of the craft. Or the reppetition. But for me, knitting still has my heart. 
 
###### Ranking: 3/5 If you can get through the setup, you can do it!

###### Reccomend: Why not? This is an especially great hobby



## Final Thoughts
New skills are so fun tor try. Clearly, I think it is always worth it to try a new skill even if it ends up not going so great.
How would you know if you don't try, though?!
