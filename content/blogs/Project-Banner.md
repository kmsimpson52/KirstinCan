Birthday season is quickly approaching for someone I hold very near and dear. It is time to plan the theme and the decor, and of course, one of my favorite parts, the cake.
But, the cake isn't somthing I need to prepare miles in advance. 

No. It is decor time. And becasue I am me, it is time to try to do a DIY in my very sparse free time. 
Let's do it. 

### Concept

Cotton. Birthday. Banner. 

Not only is it fun (I love a good birthday celebration), it is also sustainable, and (I hope) has that loving hommade touch. 
Here are some of the inspirational designs I found online.


Lovely. Vibrant. To me, these are just joyus. They have good celebration energy.
Why not buy them? Two things, really.
1. Cost. Things always cost.
2. And, I am always convinced, despite skipping math, that I can make things in a more affordable way.
