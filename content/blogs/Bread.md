Have you ever used a bread machine to make bread? I have not. Not personally. Well, not before. But, I can now! 
And I am very excited about it.

While I do enjoy baking, I am not very experianced with bread. Somehow, that was never interesting to me. So I stuck to the sweets, not the savory. 
But earlier this year, I finally made some bread in a dutch oven, with expired yeast. And you know what? It was actually not too bad. Not being a bread conisuur, it might have been terrible. I was just pleased to be able to remove something from the oven that was not dough. 
So I made more dutch oven bread. I ended up making several loaves, actually.

That started a bit of a trajectory for me. 

Now I am making bread with even less effort than I ever thought possible, with my bread machine! It is fantastic. The bread is fantastic. It is a good life.


## The Machine

My bread machine is new to me. Sort of. But it is not new.
When my mom had the opportunuty to upgrade to a newer bread machine, she gave me her old one. And what an absolute treat it has been. Since time is a premium around here, I have never been happier to be able to add ingredients to the mixing pan and blissfully forget about the whole thing. Until the pleasant (very loud) beep alerts me it is bread-o-clock. Nice.

## The Recipies

Along with the machine, I was gifted three recpies: 
1. White Bread. A classic, simple bread recipe. Basic, but a favorite all the same. 
2. Herb Bread. Very loaded with spices. Very fun.
3. French Honey Loaf. This one calls for olive oil, which I was not expecting.
