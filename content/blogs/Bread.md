Have you ever used a bread machine to make bread? I have not. Not personally. But, I can now! 
And I am very excited about it.

During the Pandemic Lockdown, when it seemed like 4/5 people were working on sourdough starters, and perfecting hommade bread, I was not.
Now, I feel  behind.

Earlier this year, I finally made some bread in a dutch oven, with expired yeast, to moderate success.
